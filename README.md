I have realised that I want to be able to take a quick project related notes once in a while or event maybe to have a simple to-do list for a particular task. Usually, I use Bear or Things to manage that, but I find it a bit too much usually and this is the main reason behind this extension. Since I work in a teams most of the time, my `.nova` folder is under `.gitignore`. This way I can keep **Scratchpad** notes private.

There’s no roadmap yet, but I’d like to add a search within notes feature and possibly support for folders in the future.

I hope you find this extension useful. If you run into an issue or have an idea to improve it, please let me know!
